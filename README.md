# Hypothesis-Testing-Assignment
1. A higher hospitalization rate gives a higher fatality rate
2. A higher ICU rate gives a higher fatality rate
3. As restriction lifted with Open Texas the rate of infection increased, with a slight delay
4. More testing leads to lower transmission later
5. Higher population density means higher transmission rate
6. Rural counties neighboring urban areas had higher rates than rural counties not near urban areas
7. Travel between regions affected spread
8. Rural counties had less spread (low population, as opposed to population density)
